All 3 device folders are needed to build

Most other edits were from @Goos03/amarc78/@JasonM45 's work that's no longer available for public access. Many apologies for not continuing commit histories. I'm a noob and try to do shit the fast/easy way when possible, avoiding the thousands plus Overlay files which would take a stupid ling time to erase individually (was fast er to upload only a few files) which tend to piss ppl off. They were all last minute uploads which weren't available anywhere else in GitHub.
